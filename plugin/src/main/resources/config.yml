  Restart:
        # Whether scripts are allowed to stop or restart your server.
        # This is usually only done intentionally, and quite identifiable if done on accident,
        # Though you may wish to disable this if your server is stopping and you don't know why,
        # or are just concerned about security in general.
        # Generally only restart should be on. Exception examples include a server manager system, which would restart
        # a server that stops more 'properly' than the restart command might.
        #
        # Note that it is still possible at this time to 'execute' a stop or restart instruction, which can be

  Yaml:

        # Set to 'false' if you're worried about security.
        Allow saving outside folder: false
  Webget:
        # Whether to allow scripts to read arbitrary data from the web, which can also potentially enable tracking of your private server data.
        # Generally this is safe, but set to 'false' if you want very strict security.
        Allow: true
    # GENERAL SECURITY NOTE: Always run your server on a user with access to nothing but the minecraft folder
    # Otherwise, a bad script or plugin could potentially damage things (though being careful with these settings should reduce the risk of a script doing so)
    # ALSO: Always read scripts you download for anything suspicious looking, EG the log command, the file_delete mechanism, ...

Packets:
  # Whether to allow Denizen to intercept packets from and to player clients.
  # This enables access to certain ScriptEvents, such as PlayerSteers and PlayerReceivesMessage.
  # It also enables hiding item script IDs and most likely has no real reason to be disabled.
  # Note that changing this setting requires a full server restart.
