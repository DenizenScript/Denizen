        Allow symbols in names: false
  Delete:
        # Whether scripts are allowed to delete files from your server

  Remove:
        # If set to true, the 'remove' command will always show a warning if it's removing all entities of a type from the world.

  Restart:

        # a server that stops more 'properly' than the restart command might.
        #
        # Note that it is still possible at this time to 'execute' a stop or restart instruction, which can be

  Webget:
        # Whether to allow scripts to read arbitrary data from the web, which can also potentially enable tracking of your private server data.

        Allow: true
    # GENERAL SECURITY NOTE: Always run your server on a user with access to nothing but the minecraft folder
    # Otherwise, a bad script or plugin could potentially damage things (though being careful with these settings should reduce the risk of a script doing so)
    # ALSO: Always read scripts you download for anything suspicious looking, EG the log command, the file_delete mechanism, ...

  Offline player cache timeout: 300
  # When set to 'true', player data will be loaded offthread during the login sequence, to avoid adding load to the server while players join.
  Load async on login: true
  # When set to 'true', all automatic flag cleanups will be skipped.
  # This might save some processing time on servers that rarely use flag expirations, but otherwise should be left as 'false'.
  Skip flag cleaning: false

Packets:
  # Whether to allow Denizen to intercept packets from and to player clients.
  # This enables access to certain ScriptEvents, such as PlayerSteers and PlayerReceivesMessage.
  # It also enables hiding item script IDs and most likely has no real reason to be disabled.
  # Note that changing this setting requires a full server restart.
  Interception: true
  # Whether to automatically initialize the packet interceptor at startup.
  # If false, it will only initialize once at least one packet-interception command or event is used.
  # This defaults to false to avoid any possible interference on servers that don't need packet interception.
  # If this is false, some packet-interception related tags may not work.
  Auto init: false

# This is a special map of custom colors by name, for the '&' tag base to use. 'default' is used when the name is unrecognized. You can add extra keys here.
# Tags work here and will be pre-parsed at load time. RGB color codes work here.
