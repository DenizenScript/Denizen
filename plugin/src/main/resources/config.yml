        # For example, generating fake tab list entries that look like real players is considered forbidden by Mojang, and may result in your server being blacklisted.
        # Scripters caught abusing these tools may also be refused support by the Denizen team or on other support platforms.
        # However, the code needed to do that can also perform useful behaviors, such as better organizing the tab list, or allowing custom tab completions.
        # As such, you are able to change the 'Allow restricted actions' setting to 'true' if you wish to achieve the non-restricted results that require restricted code access.
        # Note that you have been warned of the potential consequences of abusing these tools,

# Java Reflection is the toolkit for accessing raw underlying Java data.
# Denizen partially exposes this, for example in 'JavaReflectedObjectTag', as some scripts may have use for this.
# This however often isn't needed, and sometimes can be abused to access things a script shouldn't have access to.
# Accordingly, security-minded server owners might prefer to lock all reflection-allow options to 'false' to be safe.
# However, the default settings of allowing reads but not writes or executions is safe for most servers.
# Only servers that really need it should enable write/execute options.
Reflection:
    # Whether to allow tags to read raw field data in scripts. This is generally safe.
    Allow reading fields: true
    # Whether to allow scripts to reflect into core object methods like "toString" or "equals". This is usually safe, but might be abusable in certain edge edges, if for example some object somewhere improperly handles the "equals" method to execute logic or similar.

    #
    # ==== WARNING ====
    # If a scripter or script's documentation has told you to enable access to reflection methods in your config, that script should be scrutinized very carefully.
    # Make sure either you know exactly what it's going to do, or you very much trust whoever gave you it.
