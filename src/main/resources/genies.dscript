# Whenever you want to get all the values of a flag and loop through them
# in a task of your choice, you can easily do it using the Generic Loop
# task included in Denizen.
#
# Simply use the following command:
# - runtask "script:Generic Loop" "context:Your Task|Your Flag's name|Your Flag's type"
#
# And add speed:0 (or any speed you like) and context:value to your task,
# right under type:task.
#
# Then you're all set. The Generic Loop will run your task once for every
# value inside the flag. Use the <context.value> tag in your task to get
# the current value sent to the task.
#
# To see a quick example of how it works, give the "Generic Looper"
# assignment to an NPC and click on it. It will announce all the values
# from the player flag Cookies.
