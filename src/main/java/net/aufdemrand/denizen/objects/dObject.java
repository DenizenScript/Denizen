// @group Object System
// @description
// dObjects are a system put into place by Denizen that make working with things, or 'objects',
// in Minecraft and Denizen easier. Many parts of scripts will require some kind of object as an
// argument, identifier/type, or such as in world events, part of an event name. The dObjects notation
// system helps both you and Denizen know what type of objects are being referenced and worked with.
//
// So when should you use dObjects? In arguments, event names, replaceable tags, configs, flags, and
// more! If you're just a beginner, you've probably been using them without even realizing it!
//
// dObject is a broader term for a 'type' of object that more specifically represents something,
// such as a dLocation or dScript, often times just referred to as a 'location' or 'script'. Denizen
// employs many object types that you should be familiar with. You'll notice that many times objects
// are reference with their 'dObject notation' which is in the format of 'x@', the x being the specific
// notation of an object type. Example: player objects use the p@ notation, and locations use l@.
// The use of this notation is encouraged, but not always required.
//
// Let's take the tag system, for example. It uses the dObjects system pretty heavily. For instance,
// every time you use <player.name> or <npc.id>, you're using a dObject, which brings us to a simple
// clarification: Why <player.name> and not <p@player.name>? That's because Denizen allows Players,
// NPCs and other 'in-context objects' to be linked to certain scripts. In short, <player> already
// contains a reference to a specific player, such as the player that died in a world event 'on player dies'.
// <p@player.name> would incorrectly reference the player named 'player', however this format is often
// used to help with usage of a tag, simply indicating 'any player object'.
//
// dObjects can be used to CREATE new instances of objects, too! Though not all types allow 'new'
// objects to be created, many do, such as dItems. With the use of tags, it's easy to reference a specific
// item, say -- an item in the Player's hand -- items are also able to use a constructor to make a new item,
// and say, drop it in the world. Take the case of the command/usage '- drop i@diamond_ore'. The item object
// used is a brand new diamond_ore, which is then dropped by the command to a location of your choice -- just
// specify an additional location argument.
//
// There's a great deal more to learn about dObjects, so be sure to check out each object type for more
// specific information. While all dObjects share some features, many contain goodies on top of that!
//
