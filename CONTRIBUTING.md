## Signing

Please sign [the Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/DenizenScript/Denizen-For-Bukkit).

## Pull Requests

For pull requests:
- You MUST: own the code you submit OR it is free/open/safe to use, EG it is in the public domain. Code gathered from within any open source DenizenScript project is valid to include here as well.
	- If your code is under any pre-existing license, you MUST note it in the pull request.
- Any and all code you submit is subject to the mini-license below.
- In general, you should confirm your PR is functional in any ways that it may vary.
	- EG if your code adds an NMS call, it should be tested across multiple game versions.
- USUALLY, your pull request should fix an open issue or feature request made in a Discord thread.
	- If there is no issue or thread for it, please open a thread.
	- If issues or threads for it have been closed with a refusal statement, ensure you want to be making a PR at all before bothering with it. Generally, refused requests means PRs are also refused.
		- The exception to this is when an issue is only partially related to what you're doing, or you believe in good faith that the issue was refused on grounds made irrelevant by your adaptation of it.
			- In these cases, please open a new issue or thread.

## Code Style / Formatting

Match the general format/style of existing code within the project. For the most part, this is standard Oracle Java code conventions. As a particular difference from some standards, there must always be a newline after `}`.

## Mini-license pre-warning

By contributing to the project, you give up all rights to your contribution\*.

If you later decide you don't want us using your code - you may make a polite request and it will be treated as such, but that is the extent of your abilities.

\* This does not include your rights to continue making use of any involved code yourself, which you of course may continue to do. You give up specifically your rights to the contribution *within this project*. Or to put it another way: your rights to the specific copy of the contribution that is now contained within this project, as specifically opposed to ideas and/or expressions thereof within the code or other work contributed, which you remain free to do with as you wish (excluding actions that conflict with our ownership of the copy given to us).

### You agree by contributing:

- That you have read and agree to this document.
- To not attempt to "revoke rights to your code" or any similar action.
- That you have the right to publicly contribute any assets/code given. (IE, no contributing someone else's code without their permission)
- That the code submitted is either your own work, dedicated now to this project, OR it is under a license specified directly in the contribution.
